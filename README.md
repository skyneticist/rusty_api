# rusty_api
Simple API written in Rust using TDD (when possible) -- this is my way of learning Rust <3

# In Progress !

# Notes:
  - SpaceX API endpoints are used for testing/development purposes
  - For now, the goal is to keep this relatively simple, straightforward
  - Code base to be used for quickly getting started on a Rust-driven API
